# Exercise 10 (detect ranges)
# Create a function named detect_ranges that gets a list of integers as
# a parameter. The function should then sort this list, and transform
# the list into another list where pairs are used for all the detected
# intervals. So 3,4,5,6 is replaced by the pair (3,7). Numbers that are
# not part of any interval result just single numbers. The resulting
# list consists of these numbers and pairs, separated by commas. An
# example of how this function works:
#
# print(detect_ranges([2,5,4,8,12,6,7,10,13]))
# -> [2,4,5,6,7,8,12,10,13]         # sorted
# -> [[2],[4,5,6,7,8],[10],[12,13]] # grouped
# -> [(2,1)(4,9),(10,1),(12,14)]    # ranged
# -> [2,(4,9),10,(12,14)]           # ranged
# Note that the second element of the pair does not belong to the range.
# This is consistent with the way Pythonâ€™s range function works. You may
# assume that no element in the input list appears multiple times.
